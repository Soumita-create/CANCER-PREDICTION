# CANCER-PREDICTION

## Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a tumor is malignant (M) or benign (B) based on medical diagnostic data. The pipeline includes preprocessing, training, evaluation, and saving the model for later use.

## Technologies Used
Python 3

pandas, numpy (data handling)

seaborn (visualization)

scikit-learn (modeling, pipelines)

pickle (model persistence)

Google Colab

## Output
A trained machine learning model (CancerPredictionModel.pkl)

Plots showing data distribution and model evaluation metrics
